You need some time to make these systems stick.</p><p>Today, then, is for taking stock and <strong>settling into some of these new systems</strong>. Let's go over them in turn.</p><h2>Fun with Browsers</h2><p><strong>How is the new browser working out for you</strong>? Did you find something you liked? Are you on Firefox and have you tried Vivaldi or DuckDuckGo? Give yourself a little time to play around, load your favorite sites, and get a sense of where the settings are.</p><p>Let's also make sure you have <strong>strong security settings </strong>on Firefox as your "daily driver" (a general-purpose browser-- and if you're on a different browser, make sure you know where these privacy options are). Load the Settings panel by clicking on the three lines on the top right. Then, under Privacy &amp; Security:</p><ul><li>Select Strict under Enhanced Tracking Protection</li><li>Click Tell websites not to sell or share my data</li><li>Click Send websites a “Do Not Track” request</li><li>Delete cookies when Firefox is closed (you can add exceptions if there are any)</li><li>Select a time period for Firefox forgetting your browsinghistory</li><li>Deselect sending firefox data to improve their produce</li><li>Check and restrict permissions for location, camera, microphone, etc.</li></ul><p>Here are some <strong>ideas for extensions</strong>, many of which are available for other browsers as well:</p><ul><li><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);"><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firefox Multi-Account Containers</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/facebook-container/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook Container</a>: These extensions makes sure that your accounts stay "contained" within their tabs and don't follow you around the web.</span></li><li><a href="https://privacybadger.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Badger</a>: By the Electronic Frontier Foundation, is good at stopping browser fingerprinting. </li><li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">uBlockOrigin</a> is a well-loved ad blocker that also stops cookies, beacons, and trackers, not just ads. I personally used <a href="https://www.ghostery.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghostery</a> for many years and also appreciate <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/disconnect/?src=external-product-icon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">disconnect.me</a> .</li><li>For Firefox, I like <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lightbeam-chikl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lightbeam</a> as a revealing data privacy visualizer. It shows a network graph of all the sites you've visited (since last clearing your cache) and how they are connected through third party advertising.</li><li>A contact recommended <a href="https://noscript.net " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://noscript.net </a>which blocks scripts from running on your browser and also stops fingerprinting. It is available for Firefox.</li></ul><p><strong>A thought about adblockers</strong>. Many of them stop you from seeing ads, but they don't stop companies from seeing you when you visit their site. You want to be sure to find an adblocker that blocks the trackers, not just ads. Second, I actually find ads useful as a form of feedback on my privacy practices. If I go shoe shopping and I'm traked so I start seeing shoe ads, I know I've been tracked. If I go shoe shopping and I'm tracked but my ads are blocked, I'll never know.I</p><h2>Email Everywhere All At Once</h2><p>So you signed up for new email services: great! Now let's be sure you actually have access to those email accounts before your free trial expires.</p><p>Set up your mail applications so that they can access your new mail accounts. You want to look on their website for "IMAP" or "SMTP" instructions to set this up. Try sending and receiving a message from the account to be sure it works.</p><p>If you're on a Mac (or an iPhone), you can use the built-in Mail app to access anything with IMAP/SMTP instructions. Windows also has a Mail app.</p><p>Anyone can also download <a href="https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thunderbird</a>, a free and open source mail application from Mozilla, to manage your messages on Mac, PC, Android or iOS. Definitely put this on your Android phone as it's your alternative to the Gmail app on Android.</p><p>If you have Protonmail, <a href="https://proton.me/mail/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you'll need to download their own app for access</a>, both on your desktop and on your phone or table. </p><p>Make sure you have something like Mac Mail or Thunderbird downloaded to your computer before we move on with email. You will need it for moving mail between your existing and new accounts so that you can balkanize effectively.</p><h2>Roadmap, Revisited</h2><p>Don't forget to revisit your <strong>Data Roadmap</strong> as you remember all your various sites and services. You can also take a minute to reflect on what you've written down. Are there some you're willing to dump? For the rest, will you bring the data home, balkanize your accounts, render to Caesar, or run your own show?</p><p>Enjoy settling in before we move on!</p><p> </p></div><footer><div class="post__tags-share"><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://www.optoutproject.net/tags/cleanse/">Cleanse</a></li></ul><aside class="post__share"><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.optoutproject.net%2Fday-five-settling-in%2F&amp;via=%40cyberlyra&amp;text=Day%20Six%3A%20Settling%20In" class="js-share twitter" aria-label="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://www.optoutproject.net/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg></a></aside></div></footer></div></article><div class="banner banner--after-post">Follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/cyberlyra">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://mastodon.social/@cyberlyra">Mastodon</a>, or get my <a href="https://buttondown.email/optoutproject">newsletter</a>.</div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright Janet Vertesi 2022. <a href="https://cyberlyra.github.io/cyberlyra/my-privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy.</a> For more Opt Out tips, visit me on <a href="https://twitter.com/cyberlyra">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://mastodon.social/@cyberlyra">Mastodon</a>, or get my <a href="https://buttondown.email/optoutproject">newsletter</a>.</div></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
