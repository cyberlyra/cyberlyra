The answer is: a lot of different systems. That's not because Google is difficult to replace, per se. It's because I'm not about to give all my data to one system, whether that's Google or Yahoo!, Apple or Microsoft. I want my online data to be fractured, so that each company can only see one shard of my reflection in a broken mirror. I write more about this technique in my post on "data Balkanization," but in general, leaving Google means I'm not about to jump into bed with the next platform giant that comes along.</p><p>Also, before you get started leaving Google, be sure to read my post about the Tech Breakup. You can't just, edge your way out of the relationship with Google. Its tendrils are long. You have to be <em>prepared, </em>or leaving cold turkey is gonna leave you in the lurch, instead of Google. (Hint: they won't miss you. Better yet, you won't miss them.)</p><p>Key functionalities to replace on a daily basis? Search, email, browser, and maps, videos, calendars and file sharing. If you're a Chrome or Android person, then you're looking for a new operating system too: more on that in other posts. Each of these devices and services I've replaced with a different one--sometimes more than one service, if I want to keep my data safely segmented. I've spent a lot of time trying out many, many different systems. And I don't tend to keep my eggs in one basket.</p><p>In the coming months I'll do a more in-depth review of the services I know and love, things I've tried and tested.  I'll update this page with links when those posts go live. For now, though, here are the top contenders that I keep reaching for, time and again. </p><p>Before we get started, if you haven't yet deleted your GoogleID, then at least sign out of all Google services and clear your browser's cache.  Otherwise Google will follow you as you try out these alternatives. Which is missing the point.</p><h3>Search</h3><p>I've used lots of search engines, but I keep coming back to <a href="http://www.DuckDuckGo.com">www.DuckDuckGo.com.</a> Make it your homepage. They don't monetize based on aggregate search data, which is a fancy way of saying that they don't mine you for information, don't use your extracted data to profit on selling ads to your eyeballs, and don't put you in a filter bubble either. Plus DuckDuckGo has these cool search terms called "bangs," which is tech-speak for the exclamation mark. Search something with a "!m" and it'll search a map, with !v and it searches videos, !a pings Amazon. If you end up with a Google map or video on YouTube, it's through a proxy so Google can't track you. I've heard some people say they have trouble finding what they want on DuckDuckGo, but I've never had that problem. Maybe they're just so wrapped up in their filter bubble it looks like they can't find <em>what they want to see, </em>which is a different problem altogether and something I'm keen to avoid. Still, it I'm super curious about what people might be seeing on a Google search, I might run a search at <a href="http://www.startpage.com">www.startpage.com</a> which pings Google though a protective layer.</p><h3>Email</h3><p>The trick is to actually have lots of email addresses, but more on that later. I go with services that don't track or mine inboxes, like Protonmail.ch, Zoho.com, or self-hosted email (we do ours through <a href="http://www.ionos.com">www.ionos.com</a> webhosting). The cool thing about running your own email server is you can make unlimited addresses at will, so every company that wants your email address can have their own unique version.  That limits their ability to aggregate your personal data. You can also get a taste of this with new browser plugins from DuckDuckGo and Mozilla that make spoof email addresses for you to give away for discounts at the till, without risk of data </p><h3>Browser</h3><p>Chrome is a nightmare. You can build your own version using the Chromium kernel, or if the sentence I just wrote looks like gibberish to you then download Firefox already. When it comes to privacy and blockers, Mozilla has your back. Plus basically all your plugins on Chrome are available on Firefox too. Get off Chrome. It's a Google backdoor.</p><h3><strong><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;">Maps</span></strong></h3><p>Years ago, when Apple Maps first came out and all the buildings in 3D view were rendering to look like the Leaning Tower of Pisa, I wrote a love letter to Apple Maps that got a lot of ridicule. I was just happy to see an alternative out there! I still use Apple Maps but also spread traces across Bing's mapping service, Pure Maps, Here.com, Open Street Maps, and Organic Maps.</p><h3>Videos</h3><p>I remember when YouTube was this weird video dating site that people didn't think would amount to much. Then it was acquired by Google. Now it's simply the biggest video sharing site in the world, and it's hard to avoid. When possible I get videos from places like Vimeo, but much of the time I just have to figure out how to get what I want from YouTube without them logging that I'm watching it. Searching for videos through DuckDuckGo using the !v function lets you play YouTube videos through their proxy, and you can always load up a VPN to browse from a fresh IP, load things in a private browsing window, and clear your cache often. Not being logged into Google or having any stable Google account goes a long way toward keeping them in the dark. If you're comfortable with the command line you can try <em>youtube-dl</em>, which will scrape and save a local copy of a YouTube video on your own computer. I mention it for completeness as this is not legal. But hey, it used to just be normal to watch things without being tracked by anyone. So for your next assignment, spend a little time wondering how we ended up in a situation where trying not to be tracked to allow people to make money off our eyeballs, is illegal. </p><h3>Calendars and other office stuff</h3><p>Most of the email services you will soon be signing up for to avoid Gmail will also come with a calendar. Apple has calendars too. Or you can try running your own. I love sandstorm.io which lets you run your own mini-server, keeping your data separated even from other systems you spin up on the same server.</p><p>I'll cover alternatives to Google Meet, gChat, and others in separate posts. And I will devote a lot of time to alternative phones, operating systems, and other home automation machines. Remember, this doesn't have to be an extreme form of digital veganism. You're just extracting your life from a platform giant, trying to spread your traces about, and share the love with systems that treat you and your data better.</p><p> </p></div><footer><div class="post__tags-share"><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="http://www.optoutproject.net/tags/everyday-apps/">Apps</a></li><li><a href="http://www.optoutproject.net/tags/basics/">Basics</a></li><li><a href="http://www.optoutproject.net/tags/reviews/">Reviews</a></li><li><a href="http://www.optoutproject.net/tags/search/">Search</a></li></ul><aside class="post__share"><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.optoutproject.net%2Fthe-best-non-google-search-engine%2F&amp;via=%40cyberlyra&amp;text=Google-Free%20Living%20(it's%20better%20here)" class="js-share twitter" aria-label="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="http://www.optoutproject.net/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg></a></aside></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a class="post__nav__link" href="http://www.optoutproject.net/sailfish-the-iphone-and-android-alternative/" rel="prev">Previous Post<h3 class="h6">Sailfish: the iPhone and Android Alternative</h3></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a class="post__nav__link" href="http://www.optoutproject.net/this-is-a-first-post-title/" rel="prev">Next Post<h3 class="h6">Welcome to the Opt Out Project</h3></a></div></nav></footer></div></article><div class="banner banner--after-post">Follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/cyberlyra">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://mastodon.social/@cyberlyra">Mastodon</a>, or get my <a href="https://buttondown.email/optoutproject">newsletter</a>.</div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright Janet Vertesi 2022. <a href="https://cyberlyra.github.io/cyberlyra/my-privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy.</a> For more Opt Out tips, visit me on <a href="https://twitter.com/cyberlyra">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://mastodon.social/@cyberlyra">Mastodon</a>, or get my <a href="https://buttondown.email/optoutproject">newsletter</a>.</div></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
