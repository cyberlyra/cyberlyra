            "content_html": "<p>I think about leaving a tech service, platform, or system like leaving a relationship.  <strong>Essentially, it's a break up</strong>. After all, we're in intimate relationships with all kinds of companies and devices. We count on them hundreds of times a day in our daily lives, for something to watch, someone to talk to, a lift somewhere, you name it. You might even sleep with your cell phone.</p>\n<p>I'm not the first person to talk about <a href=\"http://catherineprice.com/how-to-break-up-with-your-phone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">breaking up with a technology</a>. I do take the analogy pretty far, though. Just like leaving a partner, <strong>the best and most long-lasting breakups are planned.</strong> Blow up and leave in the heat of the moment and you may soon find yourself crawling back. That's because really breaking up, for good, means adjusting your habits. You can do it, but it takes planning to execute well.</p>\n<p>You'll also <strong>battle against the comfort of staying put</strong> even when you know things are bad. You'll wonder if something better is truly out there. There's that feeling of uncertainty as you set out alone, the fear that stops you from taking the plunge. That uncertainty doesn't mean it's wrong to leave. Joy may be right around the corner--with a different service, even!--but you won't find it unless you take that first step.</p>\n<p>I've used my Break Up technique to leave Google in 2012, Facebook in 2016, and my last iPhone in 2017, and many more.  You can use this technique for Twitter, Amazon, Netflix, Spotify, whatever you choose. Just know it is possible, and it's not the end of the world. <strong>You <em>can </em>live online according to your values.</strong> </p>\n<p>So here is my hard-won, step-by-step guide to leaving a technological system behind, for good. Use it on the tool or service of your choice. </p>\n<h1>Step 1. Don't forget your sweater.</h1>\n<p>You storm out angrily, toss the key in the trash, vow you'll never return. It's the last straw, and you're through this time for good. The night chill finally seeps into your skin, and you realize. You left your sweater. Your favorite sweater. The one your grandmother knit for you before she died. Do you go back and retrieve it, get stuck in the \"I'm sorrys\" or \"It'll be better next time, I promise\"? <strong>Or do you move on with your life?</strong></p>\n<p>Don't put yourself in this position! <strong>If you're going to leave, plan to take your stuff with you.</strong> Most platforms and services allow you to download the information they have about you. Take your time and do an inventory. What do they have that you need? </p>\n<p>Maybe it's your friends' phone numbers, email addresses, or birthdays. Record them elsewhere or write them down in a diary. Maybe it's your community's announcements. Sign up for an alternative mail list so you stay in the know. Maybe it's all your photos. Download them, and delete. Maybe you've built up a huge, influencer-style following. Prepare your invitation to them to migrate with you, elsewhere. Remember, <strong>you can take it with you.</strong></p>\n<p>Most of the major services have instructions on <strong>how to download your data</strong>: here are a few from <a href=\"https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3024190?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google</a>, <a href=\"https://help.instagram.com/contact/505535973176353\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://support.spotify.com/us/article/data-rights-and-privacy-settings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Spotify</a> for starters. It's a good idea to do this, but don't expect the data to be in a usable format. You should still transfer key data--contacts, calendars, photos, whatever it is--manually to other systems.</p>\n<p>Note that calendars and contacts come in standardized file formats are totally transferable to other systems. .ics files for calendars and .card files for contacts are examples. You can export this data separately and import to a system of your choice when you've selected one.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/switching-chrome-firefox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Leaving Chrome for Firefox</a>? Good, it's about time. It's easy to import your bookmarks and passwords. Click the link and Mozilla will walk you through it.</p>\n<p><strong>You can start right now. </strong>Get a piece of paper, and write down what you need. What's stopping you from leaving? What's on that system you won't want to leave without? What would keep you coming back for more when you know you shouldn't?  Then retrieve it.</p>\n<p>Whatever you do, don't leave without your sweater.</p>\n<h1>Step 2. Play the Field.</h1>\n<p>There are lots of alternative services out there! Instead of jumping out of the frying pan into the fire, start by doing your research and investigating alternatives. And don't just jump into another frying pan. <strong>Breakups aren't just about leaving: they also allow us to reflect on and choose our technical bedfellows more judiciously.</strong> So if you've decided to leave Facebook for Instagram, well, let's just say you didn't do your homework.</p>\n<p><strong>Looking for an online Amazon alternative</strong>? How about <a href=\"https://www.bookstore.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bookstore.org</a>, a B-corp that gives kickbacks to independent bookstores with every purchase. Your local bookstore might also deliver or have a service for locals. <strong>Don't like Elon Musk buying Twitter</strong>? Try out <a href=\"https://mastodon.social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mastodon</a>, the federated social network that can't, technically speaking, actually belong to anyone.</p>\n<p>Some systems are a <strong>little more time consuming</strong> to replace than others.  Like Google, for instance. You might use them for a range of services like search, for email, and Maps, contacts, and of course YouTube. Maybe you even run Android. Google is counting on being so essential to your life that you won't pull the plug on them.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.optoutproject.net/the-best-non-google-search-engine/\">It takes a little more time, but you can line up alternatives just as easily</a>. When I left Google, I tried out lots of different search engines before settling on a few I really like; I experimented with lots of options for maps, email, and more. I write more about Google options <a href=\"https://www.optoutproject.net/the-best-non-google-search-engine/\">here</a>: there are a lot more that don't fit on that page, so expect more posts to come.</p>\n<p>Finally, opting out is also about reflecting on what you'd prefer in a technical bedfellow. It helped me to know <em>why</em> I was leaving--I didn't like Google's privacy policy change-- so I wouldn't <strong>just fall back into bed with yet another platform giant</strong>.  So instead of asking which service was \"better,\" I started asking: \"<em>better at what</em>?\" If the answer is, \"better at keeping my data where I own it and it doesn't fuel a twisted dystopian future,\" then Google lost every time, no matter how cool, fast, or useful Streetview is.</p>\n<h1>3. Resist Manipulation</h1>\n<p>Platforms get really, really sneaky. <strong>They don't want you to leave.</strong> They send cryptic emails. They leave environmentally-friendly messages on your empty inbox. They'll make you feel regret, pity, anguish, fear, anger--whatever it takes to get you back and clicking again.</p>\n<p>It's the worst kind of ploy from a manipulative lover. Fortunately, it's also just about <strong>the oldest trick in the book</strong>. You've seen it in movies and TV shows, it happened to you or your friend in high school, whatever--you can see it coming.</p>\n<p>And if you know it's coming, you can call a spade a spade. Steel your heart against the emotional onslaught. Remind yourself, <strong>they don't actually care about you, just your data.</strong> Close the tab, and move on.</p>\n<h1>4. Don't make up-- Break up!</h1>\n<p>Now you actually need to take the plunge. You've identified the systems you will use instead, saved all your data on a hard drive under your pillow.  <strong>Now you have to change your habits</strong>. Like a smoker trying to quit who doesn't quite know what to do with his hands at coffee break, there will be moments in your everyday routine where you will reach for that online service--and regret it later.</p>\n<p>Maybe you scrolled happily on Twitter on the train on your way to work every day. Maybe TikTok is the first thing you look at in the morning and the last thing you check at night. Maybe you always reach for your phone instead of your wallet to order, pay for, and pick up your coffee. </p>\n<p>Don't mistake the difficulty of changing your habits for regret over your break up. <strong>Make it easier by <a href=\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/\">changing your habits, one at a time.</a></strong></p>\n<p>One option is to <strong>make it harder to go back to your old favorites</strong>, and easier to choose the new path.  Change your start page and search engine on your browser: replace Google.com with <a href=\"https://www.duckduckgo.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Duckduckgo.com</a> or <a href=\"www.startpage.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">startpage.com</a>. Delete the Instagram app from your phone and download <a href=\"https://pixelfed.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pixelfed</a> instead.  Blow away Google Maps and bookmark <a href=\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OpenStreetMap</a> or <a href=\"https://organicmaps.app/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OrganicMaps</a>. If you make it hard to go back and easier to move forward, you'll move forward.</p>\n<p>Another is to <strong>make it into a game.</strong> Whenever I found myself craving Google, I stopped and asked myself if I couldn’t get it done some other way. When my thumb hovered over the spot on my phone where that big blue F was, I called a friend to picked up an. old hobby instead. After a while, it felt like a game – a game I enjoyed playing. A game I felt I was winning.</p>\n<p>You can also try good old <strong>positive reinforcement</strong>. Reward yourself for your achievements (a week with no Twitter = ice cream!). Don't set the goal too high, just celebrate your successes as they come.</p>\n<p>Either way, I recommend you <strong>don't fully delete your profile</strong>, or your account, until you have made big strides toward <strong>changing your habits</strong>. Like, 80% there. </p>\n<p>Don't get me wrong: your goal is total departure. I don't mean, not logging in anymore or letting an account lie fallow. I mean, <strong>you are going to</strong> <strong>DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT</strong>. However, if you delete too rapidly, before your alternative ecosystem is in place and your habits have shifted, you're likely to feel the regret that brings you back. And trust me, like all manipulative lovers, they all have an easy reactivation period. They're counting on you coming back.</p>\n<p>So prove them wrong.</p>\n<h1>5. The Ties that Bind</h1>\n<p>In my opt out experiments I've learned there are <strong>special rules for social media platforms</strong>. These systems don't just provide some kind of product, like looking at photos. They do so by <strong>piggybacking on your social relationships</strong>. You're looking at the same photos as your friends, exchanging comments and likes. You know what to say if someone in your social circle asks if you saw that viral video on TikTok.  All your friends are on WhatsApp.</p>\n<p>In these cases, the system has become a middleman in your relationships. And like a toxic matchmaker, <strong>it doesn't want to let go.</strong></p>\n<p>These systems are <strong>especially hard to leave</strong>. Sometimes they are outright manipulative, using your friends to guilt you back into leaving. When I tried to leave Facebook, the system showed me photos of my friends to say they would miss me if I left. It also sent me cryptic emails, with embedded links that logged me right back in again.  Because these manipulations are tied to your friends, your social relations, your work, your social capital, they are especially difficult to dodge.</p>\n<p><strong>We're more worried about losing face than losing Facebook.</strong></p>\n<p>Remember that <strong>your friends are your friends, online and off</strong>. You can be friends offline--what we used to call \"IRL.\" You can find them on alternative systems. You can ask them to join you. You can put an away message up that says, \"<strong>I left WhatsApp, join me on <a href=\"https://signal.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Signal</a></strong>,\" or \"I<strong> left Twitter, join me on <a href=\"https://mastodon.social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mastodon</a> here</strong>\".  If you're really worried about it you can write down their phone numbers or email addresses and--gasp--just call them.</p>\n<p>Seriously, your friends will be keen to talk to you whether you're on a platform or not. So will your mom.</p>\n<p>One hard-won tip, though. When you leave a social system, <strong>remember what everyone <em>else </em>is using that infrastructure for,</strong> and find an alternative for that<strong>.</strong> Maybe you need a personal website to take the place of your LinkedIn profile. In my case, <span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">after I went off Facebook, nearly everybody I knew forgot my birthday.  I went from 802 cheery (if repetitious) comments on my wall to about three phone calls. So I made a calendar invitation for my birthday, set it to \"repeat yearly,\" and sent it to my closest friends.  Problem solved.</span></p>\n<h1>Be gentle--but firm</h1>\n<p>Leaving a tech company is a process that may take some trial and error. That's why it's helpful to go through the steps above--of figuring out your needs, identifying alternatives, and changing your habits--before you click DELETE. <strong>Don't beat yourself up if it takes time to do it right.</strong> Better to walk out and never look back.</p>\n<p>Because once you do, <strong>you will feel liberated</strong>. You don't have to care about what everyone else is doing on this or that platform. You washed that tech right outta your hair and sent it on its way. You and your tech alternatives are at the beginning of a beautiful friendship. </p>\n<p><strong>Congratulations--you just opted out.</strong></p>",

            "content_html": "<p>In 2017 tech reporter <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/i-cut-the-big-five-tech-giants-from-my-life-it-was-hel-1831304194\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kashmir Hill reported on an experiment</a> trying to opt out of Google, Facebook and Amazon.  It was \"hell,\" she said. She set up a blocker on her router so no sites affiliated with the big three could get through, essentially locking herself out of the internet. She put away her smartphone and found herself without the basic tools of daily life. At one point she even locked herself out of her apartment, spending ages on a New York street corner trying desparately to piece the information she needed together to get back in. Finally she gave up, declaring that you cannot live without Big Tech.</p>\n<p>In general, I am a fan of Kashmir and her reporting. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2014/04/29/you-can-hide-your-pregnancy-online-but-youll-feel-like-a-criminal/\">We spoke years ago when I concealed my first pregnancy from the Internet.</a> And this five-week \"experiment\" made for great writing as it bordered upon the absurd.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;\">But she did us all a disservice.</span></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\"><strong>The idea is now firmly planted in people's heads that you simply cannot opt out of Big Tech.</strong> It's too hard. They're too big and too pervasive. It's also way too inconvenient: no one wants to be locked out of their apartments, or the Internet for that matter. People have given up. If you're a tech company, you couldn't have paid for better advertising.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\"><strong>This is wrong. </strong>It strips us of our one major power: the power to choose, to vote with our feet. It robs us of the chance to write our own future, to invest in non-creepy alternatives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">And it's untrue. Because you can opt out. <strong>I'm living proof. </strong></span></p>\n<p>So what did Kashmir get wrong? Where do we diverge?</p>\n<h2>1. One system at a time</h2>\n<p>Opting out takes <strong>planning and preparation</strong>. You will eventually build an entire <strong>alternative tech ecosystem</strong> from a new series of devices and services. But you cannot leap there all at once, even in five weeks. It disrupts too many of your routines, throws too many proverbial babies out with bathwater, and doesn't allow you to build robust relationships or habits that will stick.</p>\n<p><strong>Trying to opt out of everything at the same time is like that scene in the old 80's movie, <em>Airplane.</em> </strong>When something goes wrong, the captain says, \"Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit smoking!\" A few minutes later, when the next thing goes awry, the same character says, \"Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit drinking!\" And a few moments after that, \"Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit sniffing glue!\"</p>\n<p>The scene is ludicrous, because almost no one battling an addiction can<strong> successfully beat multiple addictions at once</strong>--well, unless they remove themselves entirely from society for a significant period of time. Addiction is behavioral as well as biological. You need time to change your routines and make sure those changes stick. You have to have enough support mustered around you so that you don't jump out of the frying pan -- and then decide it was pretty cosy in there and you'd rather get right back in again.</p>\n<p>Personally, I first left Google services in 2012. I was dismayed at the change to their privacy policy that allowed them to aggregate all user data around a single profile -- that's enough to make anyone pinpointable in the data, regardless of whether or not it's \"anonymized.\" (Differential privacy wasn't an option in 2012).</p>\n<p>I left Facebook in early 2016. I used the same \"<a href=\"https://www.optoutproject.net/how-to-the-tech-break-up/\">break up</a>\" <a href=\"https://www.optoutproject.net/tags/the-basics/\">technique</a> but with a few additional twists. After a lot of experimenting with alternative systems, <a href=\"#non-existing-post-with-id-5\">I put away my last iPhone for good in 2017</a>. Each of these moments took planning, ensuring I had the right systems in place to leap to, so I wouldn't look back.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\"><strong>Leave Google, Facebook, then Amazon?</strong> Yes, you can do that. Leave them </span><em style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">all at once</em><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">? You're setting yourself up to fail.</span></p>\n<h1>2. It can't be all or nothing</h1>\n<p>Perhaps surprisingly for someone who is pretty intense about data privacy, <strong>I think we should be strategic instead of extremist</strong>. For instance, going so far as to block sites hosted by the big services. Blocking Amazon W3 is like shutting off half the Internet; add Microsoft Azure and Google sites and you're left with, like, Geocities or something.</p>\n<p>It's important to demonstrate that these companies are turning themselves into the infrastructure of the internet. Of course, they're patting themselves on the back in doing so, promoting websites hosted on their own big services in your search queries.</p>\n<p>However, to hobble these companies, it is just as effective to <strong>shut off their revenue at another source</strong>. That's why I start with the main part of their money-making business, the part that fuels their investments in cloud services and helps them embed themselves in every website on the net.</p>\n<p>That is, <strong>I want to break the personal data economy</strong>: the whole system where they record everything about you online, use it to serve you personalized content, keep you addicted to scrolling, and drive wedges between you and others, and make billions while disavowing the discord that results.</p>\n<p><strong>We can do it if we just stop systems from knowing <em>everything </em>about us.</strong></p>\n<p>That's why I don't think we need to leave <em>entirely.</em> We can be <strong>selective</strong>. Divide your data up across services. Log out of the single log-ins. Set up Ghostery or Firefox containers, or another blocking system that makes it impossible for companies to track you from one site to another. Use my opt out techniques to keep your data segmented and divided up. As long as you don't let a single platform track you across the web and build up a picture of you, you are dismantling the power those companies have to ruin our lives.</p>\n<p><strong>The power of the platforms comes from tracking us across so many different parts of our lives.</strong> Meta, Google, and others do so with a single profile, their trackers embedded in our browsers when we log in, with all the data that we enter into it, including our statuses and our photographs. Oh, and by confusing us into forgetting that Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp are all actually the same company. Same with Google, Picasa, Ring and YouTube.</p>\n<p>To break that power, don't show them everything. Just opt out.</p>\n<h1>3. Empower us to make change!</h1>\n<p>The saying that you just can't opt out of Big Tech plays right into their hands. It is the kind of brand advertising those companies <em>wish</em> they could buy--and they got it for free! The idea only serves the Big Tech companies. It does not serve us.</p>\n<p><strong>Opting out should <em>undermine </em>these systems, not re-entrench them. It should make us feel empowered, not helpless. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>I am a conscientious objector</strong>. My reasons for leaving are grounded in my expertise. We are already living through the dangers that were promised by embracing <em>these </em>technologies (not <em>all</em> technologies, these data-sucking algorithmic ones).</p>\n<p>It's a one-way street to social catastrophe. No, it's not the kind of creative \"disruption\" that's just the de-facto result of innovation. It's the irresponsible result of not listening: to psychologists, historians, sociologists, human-computer interaction experts, lawyers and others who warned against the resulting ills. The results are profitable even if they are driving children to suicide, reinforcing racism, and fuelling genocide.</p>\n<p><strong>For me, opting out is a moral imperative.</strong></p>\n<p>It doesn't have to be this way. But it won't be anything different if we don't make the choice. And if we don't feel empowered, we won't make the change that's within our grasp.</p>\n<p><strong>If we don't choose different systems, we'll keep feeding racist algorithms, manipulative governments, and body dysphoria just by the very act of logging in, liking, commenting and scrolling.</strong></p>\n<p>Certainly, I understand the tactic of pushing for regulation by saying that it's too hard for individuals. I wish I could say I had faith in regulation to take this problem away from us. Maybe it's one too many clips making the rounds of a some senator \"grilling\" a social media guru, asking them to \"turn off Finsta,\" but personally I'm not holding my breath.</p>\n<p>By all means, we need smart regulation, and quickly. But the best, most long-lasting change happens from the bottom-up, not just the top-down.</p>\n<p><strong>That's why it's up to us. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Our actions matter. </strong>Like the environmental movement, making small changes in our lives can make a big difference. And like that movement too, working together is the key to getting anywhere.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">Starting from a place of powerless isn't the way forward. Working together with optimism, empowering ourselves, sharing ideas and skills: that is what animates me, and inspired me to start this site. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\"><strong><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;\">We can opt out, and we must. </span></strong></span><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">Let's build the movement, together.</span></p>\n<p> </p>",

I'm a professor at <a href=\"https://www.princeton.edu\">Princeton University</a> in the <a href=\"https://sociology.princeton.edu\">Sociology</a> department, where I'm affiliated with <a href=\"https://cs.princeton.edu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Computer Science</a>, <a href=\"http://cdh.princeton.edu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Center for Digital Humanities</a>, and the Center for Information Technology Policy.

I research NASA's robotic spacecraft teams, studying how they work together and sometimes assisting them in organizing their teams for success.  I also publish in <a href=\"https://sigchi.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Human-Computer Interaction</a>, alongside computer scientists.</p>\n<p>It's this expertise that drove me to what I now call <strong>my Opt Out Experiments</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>I've always been into computers.</strong> My dad brought our first one home in 1984, and I was hooked.  I've always had a reputation for being a geek and an early adopter. I even study robots in space!</p>\n<p>But things changed once tech companies discovered they could mine user data for advertisting. Despite study after study showing the perilous road that Silicon Valley was on, companies refused to change their path. Ignoring the rising rates of teen suicides, social unrest, conspiracy theories and misinformation bubbles, people kept logging in. </p>\n<p><strong>Algorithmic recommenders. Filter bubbles. Predictive policing. Biased datasets. Manipulation. Persuasive design. All of it fueling and fueled by a rampant collection of personal data.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>I was there</strong> while this was being developed and rolled out. I saw the writing on the wall. Anyone with my training could see the technological dystopia we're currently enduring, coming from a mile away.</p>\n<p>Maybe they thought we were just naysayers instead of experts, but we couldn't stop Silicon Valley from trampling all over those hard-won lessons from the history and sociology of technology. As a result of their indifference, people are still blissfully clicking and scrolling, and in so many predictable ways, the fabric of our society is fraying under the strain.</p>\n<p><strong>Opting out is about putting the power back in our hands, where it belongs. </strong>Amid all the heady rhetoric from Sillly Valley, it's easy to forget that technologies aren't some meteorite from outer space that hit \"society,\" transforming it from out of nowhere (trust me, I study NASA, it's not that easy). Technologies are tools we build, along the lines that we choose. The everyday devices in our pockets and on our desktops are just one vision among endless alternative possibilities. It could always be otherwise.</p>\n<p><strong>It still can. </strong><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">T</span>here are lots of ways to make digital devices, systems, and services <em>work</em>. Possibilities imbued with data stewardship and personal privacy. Tools that bring us a better, more harmonious, social world.  We can<span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\"> choose--and build--differently.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\"><strong>That's why I started opting out. </strong> </span>I have spent the last decade ditching toxic technologies, avoiding Big Tech's venomous tendrils like the plague. I did it all without living in a cave, throwing my devices away, or becoming a Luddite. I'm online, and my life is suffused with technologies. But I choose thoughtfully, ethically and responsibly. I'm not interested in if the latest blingy device comes in rose gold. Instead, I embrace companies and communities who help me to keep my data private, and to steer clear of those who don't.

            "content_html": "<p>People often ask me what I use instead of Google. The answer is: a lot of different systems. That's not because Google is difficult to replace, per se. It's because I'm not about to give all my data to one system, whether that's Google or Yahoo!, Apple or Microsoft. I want my online data to be fractured, so that each company can only see one shard of my reflection in a broken mirror. I write more about this technique in my post on \"data Balkanization,\" but in general, leaving Google means I'm not about to jump into bed with the next platform giant that comes along.</p>\n<p>Also, before you get started leaving Google, be sure to read my post about the Tech Breakup. You can't just, edge your way out of the relationship with Google. Its tendrils are long. You have to be <em>prepared, </em>or leaving cold turkey is gonna leave you in the lurch, instead of Google. (Hint: they won't miss you. Better yet, you won't miss them.)</p>\n<p>Key functionalities to replace on a daily basis? Search, email, browser, and maps, videos, calendars and file sharing. If you're a Chrome or Android person, then you're looking for a new operating system too: more on that in other posts. Each of these devices and services I've replaced with a different one--sometimes more than one service, if I want to keep my data safely segmented. I've spent a lot of time trying out many, many different systems. And I don't tend to keep my eggs in one basket.</p>\n<p>In the coming months I'll do a more in-depth review of the services I know and love, things I've tried and tested.  I'll update this page with links when those posts go live. For now, though, here are the top contenders that I keep reaching for, time and again. </p>\n<p>Before we get started, if you haven't yet deleted your GoogleID, then at least sign out of all Google services and clear your browser's cache.  Otherwise Google will follow you as you try out these alternatives. Which is missing the point.</p>\n<h3>Search</h3>\n<p>I've used lots of search engines, but I keep coming back to <a href=\"http://www.DuckDuckGo.com\">www.DuckDuckGo.com.</a> Make it your homepage. They don't monetize based on aggregate search data, which is a fancy way of saying that they don't mine you for information, don't use your extracted data to profit on selling ads to your eyeballs, and don't put you in a filter bubble either. Plus DuckDuckGo has these cool search terms called \"bangs,\" which is tech-speak for the exclamation mark. Search something with a \"!m\" and it'll search a map, with !v and it searches videos, !a pings Amazon. If you end up with a Google map or video on YouTube, it's through a proxy so Google can't track you. I've heard some people say they have trouble finding what they want on DuckDuckGo, but I've never had that problem. Maybe they're just so wrapped up in their filter bubble it looks like they can't find <em>what they want to see, </em>which is a different problem altogether and something I'm keen to avoid. Still, it I'm super curious about what people might be seeing on a Google search, I might run a search at <a href=\"http://www.startpage.com\">www.startpage.com</a> which pings Google though a protective layer.</p>\n<h3>Email</h3>\n<p>The trick is to actually have lots of email addresses, but more on that later. I go with services that don't track or mine inboxes, like <a href=\"https://www.protonmail.cn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Protonmail.ch</a>, <a href=\"https://www.zoho.com\">Zoho.com</a>, <a href=\"https://www.fastmail.fm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fastmail.fm,</a> or  running email through a webhosting service, like <a href=\"http://www.ionos.com\">www.ionos.com</a>. The cool thing about running your own email server is you can make unlimited addresses at will, so every company that wants your email address can have their own unique version.  That limits their ability to aggregate your personal data.</p>\n<p>You can also get a taste of this with new browser plugins from DuckDuckGo and Mozilla that make spoof email addresses for you to give away for discounts at the till, without risk of data loss. I recommend you install these or sign up for their services: <a href=\"https://relay.firefox.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Firefox Relay</a> and <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/email/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DuckDuckGo email protection</a>. </p>\n<h3>Browser</h3>\n<p>Chrome is a nightmare. It's a Google backdoor. GET OFF CHROME, ALREADY. Your data is completely out of your control, even in private browser mode. Google just collects everything you do. Have I made myself clear? Get. Off. Chrome.</p>\n<p>If you are really stuck on Chrome because you are committed to open source software or something, then build your own version using the Chromium kernel instead. But if the sentence I just wrote looks like gibberish to you <a href=\"https://www.firefox.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">then download Firefox already</a>.</p>\n<p>When it comes to privacy and blockers, Mozilla has your back. All your plugins on Chrome are available on Firefox too. You can easily import your bookmarks, passwords, and other tools from Chrome or Safari.  You can firewall your Facebook, Instagram, and Google tabs from others so those companies can't follow you around the web. It all takes about five minutes to do and is 100% worth it for the privacy you'll get going forward. Take five minutes when you'd otherwise be scrolling through TikTok and make the change.</p>\n<p>DuckDuckGo just came out with its own browser, which allows you to browse privately and clears your cache with a \"burn\" button. You can watch your links and history go up in flames on your screen, a reminder that your data is not going anywhere. Here it is on <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/duckduckgo-privacy-browser/id663592361\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Apple</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duckduckgo.mobile.android&amp;gl=US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Android</a>. Grab it from an APK mirror to run it on Sailfish or another Linux operating system.</p>\n<p>No, I don't get kickbacks from these companies. I've just followed their products for years and appreciate that they keep privacy central to their design. If they deviate from that strategy, I'll be out of there, fast.</p>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;\">Maps</span></strong></h3>\n<p>Years ago, when Apple Maps first came out and all the buildings in 3D view were rendering to look like the Leaning Tower of Pisa, I wrote <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2012/10/07/opinion/vertesi-apple-maps/index.html\">a love letter to Apple Maps</a> that got a lot of ridicule. I was just happy to see an alternative out there!</p>\n<p>Using my \"<em><strong>divide and conquer</strong></em>\" technique, I still use Apple Maps on occasion but I typically spread my traces around, across a combination of <a href=\"https://maps.bing.com\">Bing maps</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/rinigus/pure-maps\">Pure Maps</a>, <a href=\"https://www.here.com\">Here.com</a>, <a href=\"https://openstreetmap.org\">Open Street Maps</a>, and <a href=\"https://organicmaps.app/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Organic Maps</a>.</p>\n<p>Hot tip: if you type in an address into DuckDuckGo with an !m tag, it will search Google Maps privately for you. You can <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/bang?q=maps\">tailor its search to different map services</a> too.</p>\n<h3>Videos</h3>\n<p>I remember when YouTube was this weird video dating site that people didn't think would amount to much. Then it was acquired by Google. Now it's simply the biggest video sharing site in the world, and it's hard to avoid. When possible I get videos from places like <a href=\"https://www.vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>, but much of the time I just have to figure out how to get what I want from YouTube without them logging that I'm watching it.</p>\n<p>Searching for videos through DuckDuckGo using the !v tag lets you play YouTube videos through their proxy, and you can always load up a VPN to browse from a fresh IP, load things in a private browsing window, and clear your cache often. Not being logged into Google or having any stable Google account goes a long way toward keeping them in the dark.</p>\n<p>If you're comfortable with the command line you can try <a href=\"https://youtube-dl.org/\"><em>youtube-dl</em>,</a> which will scrape and save a local copy of a YouTube video on your own computer. Note that this has dubious legal status but I believe it's important to know your options.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">Also, take a minute to consider that <em><strong>it used to just be normal to watch things without being tracked by anyone</strong></em>.  Even four or five years ago, that was normal. Even when you rented a video cassette from Blockbuster, they weren't using that information to tag you for anything. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">So for your next assignment, spend a little time wondering how we ended up in a situation where trying not to be tracked to allow people to make money off our eyeballs, is illegal. </span></p>\n<h3>Calendars and other office stuff</h3>\n<p>Most of the email services you will soon be signing up for to avoid Gmail will also come with a calendar. Apple has calendars too. Or you can try running your own. I love <a href=\"https://www.sandstorm.io\">sandstorm.io</a> which lets you run your own mini-server, keeping your data separated even from other systems you spin up on the same server.</p>\n<p>I'll cover alternatives to Google Meet, gChat, and others in separate posts. And I will devote a lot of time to alternative phones, operating systems, and other home automation machines in future posts too, I promise.</p>\n<p><strong>Remember, this doesn't have to be an extreme form of digital veganism</strong>. You're just extracting your life from a platform giant, trying to spread your traces about, and share the love with systems that treat you and your data better.</p>\n<p> </p>",
