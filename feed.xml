                <blockquote>“Everyone has a choice – at least theoretically – but only a few have a say” (John Weeks, 2004: 138.</blockquote>
<p>When I first <a href="https://www.optoutproject.net/the-best-non-google-search-engine/">stopped using Google</a>, I got the strangest questions. How do you stay in touch with friends and family? How do you get directions? How do you do anything on the internet? <em>Do you live in a cave? </em>I was baffled at first, but over time I've started to see them as a dangerous signpost. A sign that we have left behind a world of free choices and <strong>entered the pathological state: that of the "exit option democracy."</strong></p>
<p><strong>The "exit option democracy" is premised with the idea, “<em>if you don’t like it, you can just leave</em>.”</strong> It suggests there is a free market in which there are plenty of options available to us by virtue of individual choice. Don’t like your job at Bank A? Then leave and go to Bank B -- and if you don’t like it there, try Bank C, and so on down the chain.</p>
<p>Organizational ethnographer <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/unpopular-culture-the-ritual-of-complaint-in-a-british-bank-john-r-weeks/8381919?ean=9780226878126" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John Weeks proposed this turn of phrase</a> two decades ago when studying a company with a dysfunctional culture. Dysfunctional, because what the exit option democracy <em>conceals </em>are that <strong>companies who trumpet individual choice are busy trying to <em>limit your choices </em>at the same time</strong>. They're consolidating, wage-fixing, undermining your networks, setting up walls and extra hoops for you to go through should you wish to exercise your right to choose.</p>
<p>Maybe the manager at Bank B is friends with the manager at Bank A so they won't give you a counter-offer. Maybe Banks A, B, and C are all part of a corporate chain so there is no functional difference between them. Maybe you can't pay your rent or your kids' school fees if you wait for another job, or you're worried about the sunk costs of leaving and startup costs of starting afresh. <strong>They say you can "just leave" whenever you want, but they make you feel like there isn't a choice. </strong>There end up being many reasons why individuals are actually unable to walk away.</p>
<p>In an exit option democracy, Weeks says, “Everyone has a choice – at least theoretically – but <strong>only a few have a say</strong>” (2004: 138).</p>
<h1>Defeating the Exit Option Democracy</h1>
<p><strong>Exit option democracies are not real democracies, because only a few people have a say. They're also not a true market, as they discourage true choice</strong>. They dissuade alternative choices so people can't vote with their feet, or feel discouraged if they choose differently. This sets up a vicious cycle where you may feel uncomfortable or even lost if you try to start afresh.</p>
<p>The open market, as we understand it, depends on consumer choice.  <strong>As soon as you stop exercising that choice, the market is no longer open, and we’ve collectively produced a monopoly.</strong> That works for the big technology companies – but it doesn’t work for you. A true exit option democracy relies on your ability to vote with your feet. We have to recover this option in order to truly opt out.</p>
<p>Unfortuantely, <strong>our only option in an exit option democracy is to vote with our feet</strong>. We must send a powerful message that enough is enough. It's not just that the conditions are terrible; it's also that we don't have a say in their improvement, Absent any other voice, departure is the only mechanism that matters, the only metric that counts.</p>
<p>But how do we do that when the exit option democracy is busy closing down your options, making you feel like you don't have a choice, and shouldn't take the chance on something different?</p>
<p><em><strong>Shine the light on their ruse.</strong></em></p>
<p>No matter how difficult tech companies make it seem to leave, <strong>these difficulties are manufactured.</strong> Some of them are walls they have erected, some are simply illusory. Either way, they are designed to keep you captive. Seeing these rationales, techniques, and technologies for what they truly are -- a ruse -- can help give you the personal ammunition you need to walk away. Just like knowing how a magician actually accomplished a slight-of-hand, it's empowering to be able to spot these ruses in advance, to call a spade a spade, and <strong>take courage in turning</strong> <strong>away</strong>. </p>
<p>As our options in the exit option democracy disappear one by one,<strong> opting out is more important now than ever.</strong> It is not enough to rail against big tech on Facebook, to demand that the government break up Meta, or to Tweet angrily about Twitter. The exit option democracy only works if we reject these false rationales and take matters into our own hands.</p>
<h1>The False Narratives</h1>
<h5>1. I don't have a choice</h5>
<p>The exit option democracy thrives on making sure that individuals feel that they have no choice. But, amazingly enough, <strong>you <em>do</em> have choice</strong>. There are thousands of products on the app and hardware market. For every mainstream product or service there is at least one open source alternative, a DIY option you can figure out, or a few smaller platforms and companies that are trying their hand at the game. Many people are trying out Mastodon as an alternative to Twitter, and taking their first crack at a decentralized, non-corporate web as a result.</p>
<p>Those choices <strong>offer some interesting alternatives</strong>. Some of them differentiate themselves by not slurping and analyzing your data as you search, surf, or buy. Some of them differentiate themselves by allowing you to take control of your data: storing it on your own machine, for instance. Some of them offer other options besides. In reality, there are many, many options to choose from that might better suit your needs. And if not, the miracle of code is such that you can always build your own – or ask someone to build it for you. So yes, you <em>do</em> have choice. <strong>Use it or lose it.</strong></p>
<h5>2. The progress narrative</h5>
<p>For too long, tech companies have sold themselves to us on <strong>the idea</strong> <strong>that technology equals progress</strong>. The metaverse is the future. So is social media, blockchain, biotech, AI and whatever is the latest hype for investors these days.  More technology is always better, we will always improve with the use of these tools. No one in today's day and age wants to be called a Luddite! </p>
<p>This is a powerful sales pitch, as who wants to resist the future? But it's just that: a sales pitch. In the meanwhile, these companies have built us a digital dystopia, and trapped us within it. But <strong>there are lots of ways that we can build technologies. </strong>There are many tools that are better for us than the ones we have been sold.</p>
<p><strong>Their technologies are optimized to enrich their investors, not to enrich our lives. It's a bolder future out there without them.</strong></p>
<h5><strong>3. The convenience trick</strong></h5>
<p>Calling things “convenient” is a great way to market to the contemporary middle class American consumer, someone who is working hard, blending work and home, working several jobs at a time, all the while trying to raise children, take care of aging parents and save for retirement. <strong>But convenience isn't a real, essential property of these digital tools.</strong> Many of these devices and tools only offer momentary conveniences, what I often call "micro-conveniences": two minutes shaved off your commute, $1.50 off at the till. They didn't relieve you of the <em>actual</em> inconvenience of the commute or the price of groceries. Plus, they're mainly a lure to get you to give away your personal data in the search for shortcuts through modernity. </p>
<p>I have a lot to say about this that will have to wait for another post, so this is just a teaser in the meanwhile.  <strong>Real change is complex and requires us to work together to actually have a voice: </strong>something we (conveniently, for them) can't do if we are mindlessly clicking and scrolling<strong>.</strong> Exercising your democratic option to exit these data-sucking technologies gets a lot easier once you stop falling for the simple “convenience” trick.</p>
<h5>4. What about my friends?</h5>
<p><strong>News flash: You can talk to your friends and share photos without Instagram.</strong> You can still search the internet and share documents, send pictures to your distant relatives, and cue up a playlist without Google, Spotify, or Shutterfly. You can still take photographs, juggle emails, and manage your online job cue. You can do all this online, with digital technologies. The difference is, you can <em>choose</em> the companies and services you want to do this with, all the while maintaining control of your data. <a href="https://www.optoutproject.net/tags/basics/">I have lots of recommendations that enable you to stay connected while avoiding enriching platform companies fattening themselves off your data.</a></p>
<p>It is true that these companies have held us captive by (quite literally) capitalizing upon our relationships. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2056305115603080" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Many of them started as "social networks" and built up their data mining capabilities from there</a>. This makes us feel like we won't have access to our communities if we leave. <strong><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392847" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">But communities migrate all the time</a></strong>! If your favorite dance club is now under new management and you don't like the music they play anymore, you and your friends agree to meet elsewhere.  Sociologists know that social movements depend on an "<a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.283" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">abeyance structure</a>" (usually a built facility like a church or community basement) where people can meet to discuss alternative views and build an opportunity to express their voice. In recent years, Twitter has been an "abeyance structure" for <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/4597/HashtagActivismNetworks-of-Race-and-Gender-Justice" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hashtag activism</a> with movements like Black Lives Matter and the Arab Spring. But Twitter's underlying data ecosystem of capture-and-retain-all was never in activists' favor. And abeyance structures are often subject to raids, take-over, or invasion. When that happens the community just meets somewhere else. It's the same online. It's momentarily disorienting for the community, true, but there is no penalty for moving. Sometimes even more rewards are waiting in store.</p>
<h5>5. Cuturally embedded computing</h5>
<p>What's harder to evade are the <em>cultural meanings</em> built up around technologies. It can be as large as infrastructures like an entire social media department in your company, or as complex as understanding that chatting from a "blue bubble" instead of a green one on iMessage is a sign of lower social status. We have to work together to flip these scripts. Personally, I wear my blue bubble as a badge of honor, a sign that I have recognized the extreme and devastating problems with the personal data society and am busy opting out, choosing my technologies more wisely.</p>
<p>Humans are meaning-makers, and as a sociologist I won't hesitate to tell you that culture is important. But meanings can shift, and so can culture. It is up to us to make that change, in groups, collectively. Don't let a data-sucking company define your culture for you.</p>
<h5><strong><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;">6. Community and identity</span></strong></h5>
<p>Don't let a data-sucking company define your <em>identity either. </em> Interactions with other people helps us to build up a sense of identity. For many, connecting online is what brought them to like-minded communities who let them know it was okay to be queer, or curious, or differently abled. For others, online spaces like Facebook or MySpace were simply where socialization occurred. These systems placed themselves right in the center of a very human need. Then they perched in the background, like leeches, or maybe a nest of lethal spiders, feeding off our every interaction as we built up our sense of self. They also torqued what we saw in order to incite more engagement -- and enragement at the same time.</p>
<p>I'm not saying that you shouldn't use online systems to develop a sense of self: just not <em>these systems. </em>They feel like connection, but they're extractive. It is outrageous that we allow corporations to profit off your private experiences like recognizing your sexuality or finding a date for prom. It's time to leave, and take your party elsewhere.</p>
<h5><strong><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;">7. But I'm a "digital native"...</span></strong></h5>
<p><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">Millennials and Gen Z'ers have been heralded as the first generations to be brought up truly digital. All their connections are facilitated online; they post and swipe with ease; and appear unfazed by new technical trends. But these connections have been facilitated by platform giants, facilitating the growth of a titanic industry with outsized influence and no regulation or ethical foundation. </span><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">It's especially challenging for these generations to accept that the very systems they always relied upon--the systems whose facility and expertise gave them status among their parents, teachers, and coworkers--are actually socially undermining, causing evil and hurt in the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">If you are one of these people, it's time to premise your identity upon different expertise. Entire courses at Stanford taught engineers how to hack the human perceptual apparatus for our continual attention and gratification. That's why even babies and monkeys learn quickly to swipe and click: companies engineered these systems to appear so entrancing and easy to use that we cannot help but give our data away (and not notice it in the process).  Companies conditioned you to think that faciltity with their user-friendly interfaces is the same as expertise, but you can do better. My own fearlessness with technology helped me to take the plunge and opt out, to discover new tools, communities and skills that expanded my technical horizons.  Use your technical fearlessness to try something truly new.</span></p>
<h1>Exercise your right</h1>
<p><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">An exit option democracy is not a democracy, and it's not a market. It's there to shut down the avenues you feel are available to you to send a clear message, to exercise your right to choose. This was purposeful, all part of the pursuit of platform monopoly capitalism.  But even the most ardent capitalists agree that monopolies are bad for markets. Just because </span><em style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">they have</em><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);"> </span><em style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">made it difficult to leave </em><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">and worked hard to close down our choices, doesn't mean you can't leave. <strong>In fact, it means that we must leave: or we have given in to their ruse and silenced our only voice.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);"><strong>Nothing lost, nothing gained.</strong> If anything, now is the time when the platform capitalists need to win our trust back.  Do not hesitate to walk away.</span></p>

                    <img src="https://www.optoutproject.net/media/posts/10/break-up-twitter-2.png" alt="A break-up movie poster, with Twitter substitute" />
                <p>Admit it: <strong>we're in intimate relationships with all kinds of devices, services, and tech companies</strong>. We count on them hundreds of times a day in our daily lives, for something to watch, someone to talk to, a ride someplace, and more. Chances are you sleep with your cell phone.</p>
<p>That's why leaving a tech service is like leaving a relationship.  <strong>Essentially, it's a break up</strong>. </p>
<p>I'm not the first person to talk about <a href="http://catherineprice.com/how-to-break-up-with-your-phone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">breaking up with a technology</a>. I do take the analogy pretty far, though: I've developed it into a step-by-step program.  There may be 50 ways to leave your lover, but in my view <strong>there are just four</strong> <strong>steps to leaving a tech company.</strong></p>
<h1>Set Yourself Free</h1>
<p>Just like leaving a partner, <strong>the best and most long-lasting breakups are planned.</strong> Blow up and leave in the heat of the moment and you may soon find yourself crawling back. That's because really breaking up, for good, means adjusting your habits. You can do it, but it takes planning to execute well.</p>
<p>You'll also <strong>battle against the comfort of staying put</strong> even when you know things are bad. You'll wonder if something better is truly out there. There's that feeling of uncertainty as you set out alone, the fear that stops you from taking the plunge. That uncertainty doesn't mean it's wrong to leave. Joy may be right around the corner--with a different service, even!--but you won't find it unless you take that first step.</p>
<p>I used my Break Up technique to leave Google in 2012, Facebook in 2016, my iPhone in 2017, and many more.  You can use this technique for Twitter, Amazon, Netflix, Spotify, whatever service you choose. Just know <em>it is possible</em>, it's doesn't make you a Luddite, and it's not the end of the world. <strong>You <em>can </em>live in line with your values, online.</strong> </p>
<p>So here is my hard-won, step-by-step guide to leaving a technological system behind, for good. Use it on the next tool or service you're ready to leave in the lurch. </p>
<h1>Step 1. Don't forget your sweater.</h1>
<p>You storm out angrily, toss the key in the trash, vow you'll never return. It's the last straw, and you're through this time--for good. The night chill finally seeps into your skin, and you realize... you forgot your sweater. Your favorite sweater. The one your grandmother knit for you before she died. Do you go back and retrieve it, get stuck in the "I'm sorry, baby"'s or "It'll be better next time, I promise"? <strong>Or do you move on with your life?</strong></p>
<p>Don't put yourself in this position! <strong>If you're going to leave, take your stuff with you.</strong> Most platforms and services allow you to download the information they have about you. Take your time and do an inventory. What do they have that you need? </p>
<p>Maybe it's your friends' phone numbers, email addresses, or birthdays. Record them elsewhere or write them down in a diary. Maybe it's your community's announcements. Sign up for an alternative mail list so you stay in the know. Maybe it's all your photos. Download them, and delete. Maybe you've built up a huge, influencer-style following. Prepare your invitation to them to migrate with you, elsewhere. Remember, <strong>you can take it with you.</strong></p>
<p>Most of the major services have instructions on <strong>how to download your data</strong>: here are instructions from <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3024190?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google</a>, <a href="https://help.instagram.com/contact/505535973176353" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/how-to-download-your-twitter-archive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/article/data-rights-and-privacy-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotify</a> for starters. It's a good idea to do this, but don't expect the data to be in a usable format. You should still transfer key data--contacts, calendars, photos, whatever it is--manually to other systems.</p>
<p>Note that <strong>calendars and contacts</strong> can be put into standardized file formats to transfer them to other systems:".ics" files for calendars and ".vcf" files for contacts. Every system will allow you to export this data separately, to save it to your computer. Then you can import to a system of your choice when you've gone through Step 2.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/switching-chrome-firefox" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">Leaving Chrome for Firefox</a><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">? It's about time! It's easy to <strong>import your bookmarks</strong> and passwords. Click the link and Mozilla will walk you through it.</span></p>
<p><strong>What are you waiting for? You can start right now. </strong>Get a piece of paper, and write down what you need. What's stopping you from leaving? What's on that system you won't want to leave without? What would keep you coming back for one more thing when you know you really shouldn't?  Then retrieve it.</p>
<p>Whatever you do, don't leave without your sweater.</p>
<h1>Step 2. Play the Field.</h1>
<p>There are lots of alternative services out there! Instead of jumping out of the frying pan into the fire, start by doing your research and investigating alternatives. And don't just jump into another frying pan. <strong>Breakups aren't just about leaving: they also allow us to reflect on and choose our technical bedfellows more judiciously.</strong> So if you've decided to leave Facebook for Instagram, well, let's just say you didn't do your homework.</p>
<p><strong>Looking for an online Amazon alternative</strong>? How about <a href="https://www.bookstore.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bookstore.org</a>, a B-corp that gives kickbacks to independent bookstores with every purchase. Your local bookstore might also deliver or have a service for locals. <strong>Not excited about Elon Musk buying Twitter</strong>? Try out <a href="https://mastodon.social" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mastodon</a>, the social network that can't, technically speaking, belong to anyone.</p>
<p>Some systems are a <strong>little more time consuming</strong> to replace than others.  Like Google, for instance. You might use them for a range of services like search, for email, and Maps, contacts, and of course YouTube. Maybe you even run Android. Google is counting on being so essential to your life that you won't pull the plug on them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.optoutproject.net/the-best-non-google-search-engine/">It takes a little more time, but you can line up alternatives for all of these features</a>. When I left Google, I tried out lots of different search engines before settling on a few I really like. I experimented with lots of options for maps, email, and more. I write more about my preferred Google options <a href="https://www.optoutproject.net/the-best-non-google-search-engine/">here.</a> I've been a Google conscientious objector for ten years, so there are many more tools I love that don't fit on that page: expect more posts to come.</p>
<p>Finally, opting out is also about reflecting on what you'd prefer in a technical partnership. It helped me to know <em>why</em> I was leaving Google--I didn't like their privacy policy change-- so I wouldn't <strong>just fall back into bed with yet another platform giant</strong>.  So instead of asking which service was "better," I started asking: "<em>better at what</em>?" If the answer is, "better at keeping my data where I own it and it doesn't fuel a twisted dystopian future," then Google lost every time, no matter how cool, fast, or useful Streetview is.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://www.optoutproject.net/media/posts/10/break-up-google-2-2.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://www.optoutproject.net/media/posts/10/responsive/break-up-google-2-2-xs.png 300w ,https://www.optoutproject.net/media/posts/10/responsive/break-up-google-2-2-sm.png 480w ,https://www.optoutproject.net/media/posts/10/responsive/break-up-google-2-2-md.png 768w"  alt="" width="576" height="386"></figure>
<h1>3. Resist Manipulation</h1>
<p>Platforms get really, really sneaky. <strong>They don't want you to leave.</strong> They send cryptic emails. They leave environmentally-friendly messages on your empty inbox. They'll make you feel regret, pity, anguish, fear, anger--whatever it takes to get you back and clicking again.</p>
<p>It's the worst kind of ploy from a manipulative lover. Fortunately, it's also just about <strong>the oldest trick in the book</strong>. You've seen it in movies and TV shows, it happened to you or your friend in high school, whatever--you can see it coming.</p>
<p>Once you know it's coming, you can call a spade a spade. Steel your heart against the emotional onslaught. Remind yourself, <strong>they don't actually care about you, just your data.</strong> Close the tab, and move on.</p>
<h1>4. Don't make up-- Break up!</h1>
<p>Now you actually need to take the plunge. You've identified the systems you will use instead, saved all your data on a hard drive under your pillow.  <strong>Now you have to change your habits</strong>. Like a smoker trying to quit who doesn't quite know what to do with his hands at coffee break, there will be moments in your everyday routine where you will reach for that online service--and regret it later.</p>
<p>Maybe you scrolled happily on Twitter on the train on your way to work every day. Maybe TikTok is the first thing you look at in the morning and the last thing you check at night. Maybe you always reach for your phone instead of your wallet to order, pay for, and pick up your coffee. </p>
<p>Don't mistake the difficulty of changing your habits for regret over your break up. <strong>Make it easier by changing your habits, one at a time.</strong></p>
<p>One option is to <strong>make it harder to go back to your old favorites</strong>, and easier to choose the new path.  Change your start page and search engine on your browser: replace Google.com with <a href="https://www.duckduckgo.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Duckduckgo.com</a> or <a href="www.startpage.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">startpage.com</a>. Delete the Instagram app from your phone and download <a href="https://pixelfed.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pixelfed</a> instead.  Blow away Google Maps and bookmark <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenStreetMap</a> or <a href="https://organicmaps.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OrganicMaps</a>. If you make it hard to go back and easier to move forward, you'll move forward.</p>
<p>Another is to <strong>make it into a game.</strong> Whenever I found myself craving Google, I stopped and asked myself if I couldn’t get it done some other way. When my thumb hovered over the spot on my phone where that big blue F was, I called a friend or picked up an old hobby instead. After a while, it felt like a game – a game I enjoyed playing. A game I felt I was winning.</p>
<p>You can also try good old <strong>positive reinforcement</strong>. Reward yourself for your achievements (a week with no Twitter = ice cream!). Don't set the goal too high, just celebrate your successes as they come.</p>
<p>Either way, I recommend you <strong>don't fully delete your profile</strong>, or your account, until you have made big strides toward <strong>changing your habits</strong>. Like, 80% there. </p>
<p>Don't get me wrong: your goal is total departure. I don't mean, not logging in anymore or letting an account lie fallow. I mean, <strong>you are going to</strong> <strong>DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT</strong>. However, if you delete too rapidly, before your alternative ecosystem is in place and your habits have shifted, you're likely to feel the regret that brings you back. And trust me, like all manipulative lovers, the platforms' deactivation links all come with a grace period. They're counting on you coming back.</p>
<p>You're going to prove them wrong.</p>
<h1>Step 4-1/2. The Ties that Bind</h1>
<p>Okay, not quite 4 steps: let's make it four and a half. In my opt out experiments I've learned there are <strong>special rules for social media platforms</strong>. These systems don't just provide some kind of product, like looking at photos. They do so by <strong>piggybacking on your social relationships</strong>. You're looking at photos with your friends, exchanging comments and likes. You know what to say if someone in your social circle asks if you saw that viral video on TikTok.  All your friends are on WhatsApp and your professional contacts are on LinkedIn.</p>
<p>In these cases, the system has become a middleman in your relationships. And like a toxic matchmaker, <strong>it doesn't want to let go.</strong></p>
<p>These systems are <strong>especially hard to leave</strong>. Sometimes they are outright manipulative, using your friends to guilt you back into leaving. When I tried to leave Facebook, the system showed me photos of my friends to say they would miss me if I left. It also sent me cryptic emails, with embedded links that logged me right back in again.  Because these manipulations are tied to your friends, your social relations, your work, your social capital, they are especially difficult to dodge.</p>
<p>I've been there, so trust me. <strong>You won't lose face when you lose Facebook.</strong></p>
<p>Remember that <strong>your friends are your friends, online and off</strong>. You can be friends offline--what we used to call "IRL." You can find them on alternative systems. You can even ask them to join you. Put an away message up that says, "<strong>I left WhatsApp, join me on <a href="https://signal.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Signal</a></strong>," or "<strong>I left Twitter, join me on <a href="https://mastodon.social" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mastodon</a> here</strong>".  If you're really worried about it you can write down their phone numbers or email addresses and--gasp--just call them.</p>
<p>Seriously, your friends will be keen to talk to you whether you're on their platform or not. So will your mom.</p>
<p>One hard-won tip, though. When you leave a social system, <strong>remember what everyone <em>else </em>is using that infrastructure for,</strong> and find an alternative for that<strong>.</strong> Maybe you need a personal website to take the place of your professional LinkedIn profile. In my case, <span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">after I went off Facebook, I went from eight hundred and two cheery (if repetitious) "Happy Birthday!"'s on my wall to three phone calls. Solution: I made a calendar invitation on my birthday, set it to "repeat yearly," and sent it to my closest friends.  Problem solved.</span></p>
<h1>Be gentle--but firm</h1>
<p>Leaving a tech company is a process that may take some trial and error. That's why it's helpful to go through the steps above--of figuring out your needs, identifying alternatives, and changing your habits--before you click DELETE. <strong>Don't beat yourself up if it takes time to do it right.</strong> Better to walk out and never look back.</p>
<p>Because once you do, <strong>you will feel liberated</strong>. You don't have to care about what everyone else is doing on this or that platform. You washed that tech right outta your hair and sent it on its way. You and your tech alternatives are at the beginning of a beautiful friendship. </p>
<p><strong>Congratulations--you just opted out.</strong></p>

  <p>
    I started opting out in 2012 when I stopped using Google tools and deleted my account. Since then I have built up a treasure trove of knowledge, devices, and services aimed at keeping me and my family away from the evils of data-collecting algorithmic systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>The last ten years have seen me doing things that most people, honestly, thought were crazy. Now, they're asking how I do it.</b>
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>That's why I started this site. </b>I've decided to put information about these tools and alternatives in one spot for others to find and use. Many of these tools are reviewed in the tech press, others are more bespoke but there is information out there if you know where to look. <b>My goal is to bring it all together in one place</b>, to guide you through the process, and help you opt out as well.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>I'm fed up with living in a dystopian version of the future. So I decided to do something about it.&nbsp;</b>We should all be able to live our lives without these data-sucking and socially destructive tools torquing our world. I hope this site helps you to follow along.
  </p>

    <h2 id="what-this-site-is--and-is-not">
      What this site is ... and is not
    </h2>

  <p>
    My friend Natasha is always teasing me,"You'd know about this if you were on Facebook," she says, tantalizingly offering some piece of gossip or news of an upcoming event in town, "but you're not on Facebook <b>because&nbsp;<i>you hate technology</i></b>."
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>It's not true. I actually love technology.</b> I'm a sociologist of science and technology. I got a whole doctoral degree in the study of technology and society. I publish research in human-computer interaction and I work with NASA spacecraft teams. I'm now a professor at Princeton, where I am an expert in technology and society. I'm in the Sociology department with a courtesy appointment in Computer Science. When I'm not teaching or researching I spend my spare time hacking phones and building stuff with Raspberry Pi's.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Of all people, I'm not one to hate technology. </b>So I don't think the answer is to leave technology behind altogether.
  </p>

  <p>
    That's why this site is NOT going to help you with a tech detox. I'm not here to hate on technology, or tell you to go live in a cave.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>That said, I do think we need to leave <i>these </i>technologies</b>. Google. Meta. Algorithmic systems that blend search or friendship with advertising, serve information up with a heaping dose of surveillance, and lead us all astray.&nbsp;Companies that went from "Don't be evil" to, well, being evil. Companies that ignored the warning signs and marched us boldly into a world suffused with dysfunction.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>And there were warning signs</b>. I was there, at the conferences and meetings where we warned them. Driven by profits instead of ethics, they did it anyway.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some people think regulation is the best way forward. I'm all for smart regulation of these devastating technologies. But whenever I think about government regulating these tools, I remember that senator asking Mark Zuckerberg to shut down Finsta. Those guys aren't riding in on a white horse anytime soon.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Voting with our feet is the quickest option we have, the best way to tell the tech industry that enough is enough. </b>It's no great sacrifice--there are alternatives out there, better visions of what our lives could be like. There are systems that don't require capturing and storing all our data, mining us exploitatively for profit, and serving us the kinds of misinformation and advertising that has us hating our neighbors.
  </p>

    <h2 id="its-time-to-opt-out">
      It's time to opt out.

                    <img src="https://www.optoutproject.net/media/posts/15/No-Google-round-2.png" alt="" />
                <p>In 2017 tech reporter <a href="https://gizmodo.com/i-cut-the-big-five-tech-giants-from-my-life-it-was-hel-1831304194" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kashmir Hill reported on an experiment</a> trying to opt out of Google, Facebook and Amazon.  It was "hell," she said. She set up a blocker on her router so no sites affiliated with the big three could get through, essentially locking herself out of the internet. She put away her smartphone and found herself without the basic tools of daily life. At one point she even locked herself out of her apartment, spending ages on a New York street corner trying desparately to piece the information she needed together to get back in. Finally she gave up, declaring that you cannot live without Big Tech.</p>
<p>In general, I am a fan of Kashmir and her reporting. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2014/04/29/you-can-hide-your-pregnancy-online-but-youll-feel-like-a-criminal/">We spoke years ago when I concealed my first pregnancy from the Internet.</a> And this five-week "experiment" made for great writing as it bordered upon the absurd.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;">But she did us all a disservice.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);"><strong>The idea is now firmly planted in people's heads that you simply cannot opt out of Big Tech.</strong> It's too hard. They're too big and too pervasive. It's also way too inconvenient: no one wants to be locked out of their apartments, or the Internet for that matter. People have given up. If you're a tech company, you couldn't have paid for better advertising.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);"><strong>This is wrong. </strong>It strips us of our one major power: the power to choose, to vote with our feet. It robs us of the chance to write our own future, to invest in non-creepy alternatives. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">And it's untrue. Because you can opt out. <strong>I'm living proof. </strong></span></p>
<p>So what did Kashmir get wrong? Where do we diverge?</p>
<h2>1. One system at a time</h2>
<p>Opting out takes <strong>planning and preparation</strong>. You will eventually build an entire <strong>alternative tech ecosystem</strong> from a new series of devices and services. But you cannot leap there all at once, even in five weeks. It disrupts too many of your routines, throws too many proverbial babies out with bathwater, and doesn't allow you to build robust relationships or habits that will stick.</p>
<p><strong>Trying to opt out of everything at the same time is like that scene in the old 80's movie, <em>Airplane.</em> </strong>When something goes wrong, the captain says, "Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit smoking!" A few minutes later, when the next thing goes awry, the same character says, "Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit drinking!" And a few moments after that, "Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit sniffing glue!"</p>
<p>The scene is ludicrous, because almost no one battling an addiction can<strong> successfully beat multiple addictions at once</strong>--well, unless they remove themselves entirely from society for a significant period of time. Addiction is behavioral as well as biological. You need time to change your routines and make sure those changes stick. You have to have enough support mustered around you so that you don't jump out of the frying pan -- and then decide it was pretty cosy in there and you'd rather get right back in again.</p>
<p>Personally, I first left Google services in 2012. I was dismayed at the change to their privacy policy that allowed them to aggregate all user data around a single profile -- that's enough to make anyone pinpointable in the data, regardless of whether or not it's "anonymized." (Differential privacy wasn't an option in 2012).</p>
<p>I left Facebook in early 2016. I used the same "<a href="https://www.optoutproject.net/how-to-the-tech-break-up/">break up</a>" <a href="https://www.optoutproject.net/tags/the-basics/">technique</a> but with a few additional twists. After a lot of experimenting with alternative systems, <a href="#non-existing-post-with-id-5">I put away my last iPhone for good in 2017</a>. Each of these moments took planning, ensuring I had the right systems in place to leap to, so I wouldn't look back.</p>
<p><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);"><strong>Leave Google, Facebook, then Amazon?</strong> Yes, you can do that. Leave them </span><em style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">all at once</em><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">? You're setting yourself up to fail.</span></p>
<h1>2. It can't be all or nothing</h1>
<p>Perhaps surprisingly for someone who is pretty intense about data privacy, <strong>I think we should be strategic instead of extremist</strong>. For instance, going so far as to block sites hosted by the big services. Blocking Amazon W3 is like shutting off half the Internet; add Microsoft Azure and Google sites and you're left with, like, Geocities or something.</p>
<p>It's important to demonstrate that these companies are turning themselves into the infrastructure of the internet. Of course, they're patting themselves on the back in doing so, promoting websites hosted on their own big services in your search queries.</p>
<p>However, to hobble these companies, it is just as effective to <strong>shut off their revenue at another source</strong>. That's why I start with the main part of their money-making business, the part that fuels their investments in cloud services and helps them embed themselves in every website on the net.</p>
<p>That is, <strong>I want to break the personal data economy</strong>: the whole system where they record everything about you online, use it to serve you personalized content, keep you addicted to scrolling, and drive wedges between you and others, and make billions while disavowing the discord that results.</p>
<p><strong>We can do it if we just stop systems from knowing <em>everything </em>about us.</strong></p>
<p>That's why I don't think we need to leave <em>entirely.</em> We can be <strong>selective</strong>. Divide your data up across services. Log out of the single log-ins. Set up Ghostery or Firefox containers, or another blocking system that makes it impossible for companies to track you from one site to another. Use my opt out techniques to keep your data segmented and divided up. As long as you don't let a single platform track you across the web and build up a picture of you, you are dismantling the power those companies have to ruin our lives.</p>
<p><strong>The power of the platforms comes from tracking us across so many different parts of our lives.</strong> Meta, Google, and others do so with a single profile, their trackers embedded in our browsers when we log in, with all the data that we enter into it, including our statuses and our photographs. Oh, and by confusing us into forgetting that Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp are all actually the same company. Same with Google, Picasa, Ring and YouTube.</p>
<p>To break that power, don't show them everything. Just opt out.</p>
<h1>3. Empower us to make change!</h1>
<p>The saying that you just can't opt out of Big Tech plays right into their hands. It is the kind of brand advertising those companies <em>wish</em> they could buy--and they got it for free! The idea only serves the Big Tech companies. It does not serve us.</p>
<p><strong>Opting out should <em>undermine </em>these systems, not re-entrench them. It should make us feel empowered, not helpless. </strong></p>
<p><strong>I am a conscientious objector</strong>. My reasons for leaving are grounded in my expertise. We are already living through the dangers that were promised by embracing <em>these </em>technologies (not <em>all</em> technologies, these data-sucking algorithmic ones).</p>
<p>It's a one-way street to social catastrophe. No, it's not the kind of creative "disruption" that's just the de-facto result of innovation. It's the irresponsible result of not listening: to psychologists, historians, sociologists, human-computer interaction experts, lawyers and others who warned against the resulting ills. The results are profitable even if they are driving children to suicide, reinforcing racism, and fuelling genocide.</p>
<p><strong>For me, opting out is a moral imperative.</strong></p>
<p>It doesn't have to be this way. But it won't be anything different if we don't make the choice. And if we don't feel empowered, we won't make the change that's within our grasp.</p>
<p><strong>If we don't choose different systems, we'll keep feeding racist algorithms, manipulative governments, and body dysphoria just by the very act of logging in, liking, commenting and scrolling.</strong></p>
<p>Certainly, I understand the tactic of pushing for regulation by saying that it's too hard for individuals. I wish I could say I had faith in regulation to take this problem away from us. Maybe it's one too many clips making the rounds of a some senator "grilling" a social media guru, asking them to "turn off Finsta," but personally I'm not holding my breath.</p>
<p>By all means, we need smart regulation, and quickly. But the best, most long-lasting change happens from the bottom-up, not just the top-down.</p>
<p><strong>That's why it's up to us. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Our actions matter. </strong>Like the environmental movement, making small changes in our lives can make a big difference. And like that movement too, working together is the key to getting anywhere.</p>
<p><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">Starting from a place of powerless isn't the way forward. Working together with optimism, empowering ourselves, sharing ideas and skills: that is what animates me, and inspired me to start this site. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);"><strong><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;">We can opt out, and we must. </span></strong></span><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">Let's build the movement, together.</span></p>

                <p>I believe we should all write ourselves a privacy policy: a terms of service list against which other companies need to measure up.  In the meanwhile, here is this site's pledge to you, dear visitor. I have tried to make the policy and the site in line with my values about data privacy, ownership, and stewardship.</p>
<p><strong>Your data is yours</strong>. I don't want or need to know you visited my site. I'm not keeping site tracking data.  I believe you should be able to your data to yourself, and remain in control of what data you give and to whom. I do not authorize any cookies, trackers, browser fingerprinters, or bots. I don't run any analytics.</p>
<p><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);"><strong>I built this site to be as clean as possible. </strong>Putting my opt out values first and foremost has buided my decisions about which tools to use and which to lose. You'll notice I didn't set this site up on Substack, Medium, or Wix, or a flashy hosting service that makes it "easy" to blog and subscribe. Instead, I investigated my connections to the tools that help me make it, as deeply as possible.  I don't want to risk your data being sniffed by a third party company when you visit my Opt Out site. </span></p>
<p><strong>This site is hosted on GitHub</strong>. Microsoft owns GitHub.  To the best of my knowledge they do not track people who visit their code repositories, including this site, although they very likely log IP addresses used for access. If you're worried about that, access through a VPN or the Tor browser. GitHub is making privacy policy changes that largely track Enterprise users. If I learn they are tracking site visitors, I will move this site and update this privacy policy accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>The site is static HTML and CSS.</strong> I am using the open source system called <a href="https://getpublii.com">Publii</a> to generate the blog, so that the code is as clean as possible (you might also check out the excellent <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="http://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> as blogging options).

                <p><strong>I left Google in March of 2012, Facebook in early 2016</strong>. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2014/04/29/you-can-hide-your-pregnancy-online-but-youll-feel-like-a-criminal/">In 2014 I went viral for keeping a pregnancy away from detection online.</a> I still buy everything related to my children untraceably.  In my spare time I hack cell phones.</p>
<p>Why do all this?</p>
<p>I'm an expert in the relationship between technology and society. I'm a professor at <a href="https://www.princeton.edu">Princeton University</a> in the <a href="https://sociology.princeton.edu">Sociology</a> department, where I'm affiliated with <a href="https://cs.princeton.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Computer Science</a>, <a href="http://cdh.princeton.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Center for Digital Humanities</a>, and the Center for Information Technology Policy. I have a PhD in the study of <a href="https://sts.cornell.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">science, technology, and society</a>, <a href="https://4sonline.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which is actually a field</a>. I research NASA's robotic spacecraft teams, studying how they work together and sometimes assisting them in organizing their teams for success.  I also publish in <a href="https://sigchi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Human-Computer Interaction</a>, alongside computer scientists.</p>
<p>It's this expertise that drove me to what I now call <strong>my Opt Out Experiments</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>I've always been into computers.</strong> My dad brought our first one home in 1984, and I was hooked.  I've always had a reputation for being a geek and an early adopter. I even study robots in space!</p>
<p>But things changed once tech companies discovered they could mine user data for advertisting. Despite study after study showing the perilous road that Silicon Valley was on, companies refused to change their path. Ignoring the rising rates of teen suicides, social unrest, conspiracy theories and misinformation bubbles, people kept logging in. </p>
<p><strong>Algorithmic recommenders. Filter bubbles. Predictive policing. Biased datasets. Manipulation. Persuasive design. All of it fueling and fueled by a rampant collection of personal data.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I was there</strong> while this was being developed and rolled out. I saw the writing on the wall. Anyone with my training could see the technological dystopia we're currently enduring, coming from a mile away.</p>
<p>Maybe they thought we were just naysayers instead of experts, but we couldn't stop Silicon Valley from trampling all over those hard-won lessons from the history and sociology of technology. As a result of their indifference, people are still blissfully clicking and scrolling, and in so many predictable ways, the fabric of our society is fraying under the strain.</p>
<p><strong>Opting out is about putting the power back in our hands, where it belongs. </strong>Amid all the heady rhetoric from Sillly Valley, it's easy to forget that technologies aren't some meteorite from outer space that hit "society," transforming it from out of nowhere (trust me, I study NASA, it's not that easy). Technologies are tools we build, along the lines that we choose. The everyday devices in our pockets and on our desktops are just one vision among endless alternative possibilities. It could always be otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>It still can. </strong><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">T</span>here are lots of ways to make digital devices, systems, and services <em>work</em>. Possibilities imbued with data stewardship and personal privacy. Tools that bring us a better, more harmonious, social world.  We can<span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);"> choose--and build--differently.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);"><strong>That's why I started opting out. </strong> </span>I have spent the last decade ditching toxic technologies, avoiding Big Tech's venomous tendrils like the plague. I did it all without living in a cave, throwing my devices away, or becoming a Luddite. I'm online, and my life is suffused with technologies. But I choose thoughtfully, ethically and responsibly. I'm not interested in if the latest blingy device comes in rose gold. Instead, I embrace companies and communities who help me to keep my data private, and to steer clear of those who don't. Sometimes I build things myself so that I know exactly where my data is.</p>

<p><strong>Since more and more people seem to want to know what I do and how to follow along, I started this site.</strong> I'll review some of <strong>my favorite tools</strong> and <strong>alternative options</strong> for you to consider. I'll <strong>share tips</strong> for how I manage my data in the face of an Internet hellbent on its lucrative extraction. I'll occasionally muse about <strong>what I've learned</strong> about Internet privacy while opting out.</p>
<p><strong>You can follow along online, and sign up for my mailing list to learn about fresh posts and ideas.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The opinions expressed here are entirely my own</strong>. I'm not paid for reviews of products, I'm just telling you what works for me. I'm not a journalist; I'm an academic, but I'll make every effort to make this readable. Also, since I'm all about data privacy and ownership, nothing on this website is stealing your data. You can browse, read, and subscribe in peace.</p>
<p><strong>It's time for change. </strong>Techlash is rampant, people are angry at the FAANGs and tired of the Metaverse, Crypto, and the "next big thing." Fortunately, we can, truly can, leave these systems behind in the dirt. We can put our eggs in a better basket than this.</p>
<p><strong>Let's get started.</strong></p>

                    <img src="https://www.optoutproject.net/media/posts/2/No-Google.jpg" alt="Crossed out Google logo" />
                <p>People often ask me what I use instead of Google. My answer is: a lot of different systems. That's not because Google is difficult to replace whole cloth. It's because I'm not about to give all my data to one company, whether that's Google or Yahoo!, Apple or Microsoft. I don't care how "good" their product is: I'm not about to jump into bed with the next platform giant that comes along.</p>
<p>Also, before you get started, be sure to read my post about <a href="https://www.optoutproject.net/how-to-the-tech-break-up/">the Tech Breakup</a>. You can't just edge your way out of the relationship with Google. Its tendrils are long. You have to be <em>prepared, </em>or leaving cold turkey is gonna leave you in the lurch, instead of Google. (Hint: they won't miss you. Better yet, you won't miss them.)</p>
<p>Key functionalities to replace on a daily basis? Search, email, browser, and maps, videos, calendars and file sharing. If you're a Chrome or Android person, then you're looking for a new operating system too: more on that in other posts. Each of these devices and services I've replaced with a different one--sometimes more than one service, if I want to keep my data safely segmented. I've spent a lot of time trying out many, many different systems. And I don't tend to keep my eggs in one basket.</p>
<p>On this site I'll do a more in-depth review of the services I know and love, things I've tried and tested. For now, though, here are the top contenders that I keep reaching for, time and again. </p>
<p>Before we get started, if you haven't yet deleted your GoogleID, then at least sign out of all Google services and clear your browser's cache.  Otherwise Google will follow you as you try out these alternatives. Which is missing the point.</p>
<h3>Search</h3>
<p>I've used lots of search engines, but I keep coming back to <a href="http://www.DuckDuckGo.com">www.DuckDuckGo.com.</a> Make it your homepage. They don't monetize based on aggregate search data, which is a fancy way of saying that they don't mine you for information, don't use your extracted data to profit on selling ads to your eyeballs, and don't put you in a filter bubble either. Plus DuckDuckGo has these cool search terms called "bangs," which is tech-speak for the exclamation mark. Search something with a "!m" and it'll search a map, with !v and it searches videos, !a pings Amazon. If you end up with a Google map or video on YouTube, it's through a proxy so Google can't track you.</p>
<p>I've heard some people say they have trouble finding what they want on DuckDuckGo, but I've never had that problem. Maybe they're just so wrapped up in their filter bubble it looks like they can't find <em>what they want to see, </em>which is a different problem altogether and something I'm keen to avoid. Still, if I'm super curious about what people might be seeing on a Google search, I might run a search at <a href="http://www.startpage.com">www.startpage.com</a> which pings Google though a protective layer.</p>
<h3>Email</h3>
<p>I go with services that don't track or mine inbox data, like <a href="https://www.protonmail.cn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Protonmail.ch</a>, <a href="https://www.zoho.com">Zoho.com</a>, <a href="https://www.fastmail.fm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fastmail.fm.</a> Or you can run email through a webhosting service. The cool thing about running your own email server is you can make unlimited addresses at will, so every company that wants your email address can have their own unique version.  That limits their ability to aggregate your personal data.</p>
<p>New browser plugins from DuckDuckGo and Mozilla make spoof email addresses to away for discounts at the till, without risk of data loss. I recommend you install them or sign up for their services: <a href="https://relay.firefox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firefox Relay</a> and <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/email/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DuckDuckGo email protection</a>.  For one-time-use email addresses, I reach for <a href="https://10minutemail.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10-minute-mail.</a> </p>
<h3>Browser</h3>
<p>Chrome is a nightmare. It's a Google backdoor. GET OFF CHROME, ALREADY. Your data is out of your control, even in private browser mode. Google just collects everything you do. Have I made myself clear? Get. Off. Chrome.</p>
<p>If you are really stuck on Chrome (because you are committed to open source software perhaps?), then build your own version using the Chromium kernel instead. If that sentence reads like gibberish to you <a href="https://www.firefox.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">then download Firefox already</a>.</p>
<p>When it comes to privacy and blockers, Mozilla currently has your back. All your plugins on Chrome are available on Firefox too. You can easily import your bookmarks, passwords, and other tools from Chrome or Safari.  You can firewall your Facebook, Instagram, and Google tabs from others so those companies can't follow you around the web. It all takes about five minutes to do and is 100% worth it for the privacy you'll get going forward. Take five minutes when you'd otherwise be scrolling through TikTok and make the change.</p>
<p>DuckDuckGo just came out with its own browser, which allows you to browse privately and clears your cache with a "burn" button. You can watch your links and history go up in flames on your screen, a reminder that your data is not going anywhere. Here it is on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/duckduckgo-privacy-browser/id663592361" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duckduckgo.mobile.android&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a>. Grab it from an APK mirror to run it on Sailfish or another Linux operating system.</p>
<p>I don't get kickbacks from these companies. I've just followed their products for years and appreciate that they keep privacy central to their design. If they deviate from that strategy, I'll be out of there, fast--and you'll be the first to know.</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;">Maps</span></strong></h3>
<p>Years ago, when Apple Maps first came out and all the buildings in 3D view were rendering to look like the Leaning Tower of Pisa, I wrote <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2012/10/07/opinion/vertesi-apple-maps/index.html">a love letter to Apple Maps</a> that got a lot of ridicule. I was just happy to see an alternative out there!</p>
<p>I typically spread my traces around, across a combination of <a href="https://maps.bing.com">Bing maps</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rinigus/pure-maps">Pure Maps</a>, <a href="https://www.here.com">Here.com</a>, <a href="https://openstreetmap.org">Open Street Maps</a>, and <a href="https://organicmaps.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Organic Maps</a>.</p>
<p>Hot tip: if you type in an address into DuckDuckGo with an !m tag, it will search Google Maps privately for you. You can <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/bang?q=maps">tailor its search to different map services</a> too.</p>
<h3>Videos</h3>
<p>I remember when YouTube was this weird video dating site that people didn't think would amount to much. Then it was acquired by Google. Now it's simply the biggest video sharing site in the world, and it's hard to avoid. When possible I get videos from places like <a href="https://www.vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>, but much of the time I just have to figure out how to get what I want from YouTube without them logging that I'm watching it.</p>
<p>Searching for videos through DuckDuckGo using the !v tag lets you play YouTube videos through their proxy, and you can always load up a VPN to browse from a fresh IP, load things in a private browsing window, and clear your cache often. Not being logged into Google or having any stable Google account goes a long way toward keeping them in the dark.</p>
<p>If you're comfortable with the command line you can try <a href="https://youtube-dl.org/"><em>youtube-dl</em>,</a> which will scrape and save a local copy of a YouTube video on your own computer. This has dubious legal status but I believe it's important to know your options.</p>
<p><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">Also, take a minute to consider that <em><strong>it used to just be normal to watch things without being tracked by anyone</strong></em>.  Even four or five years ago. When you rented a video cassette from Blockbuster, they weren't using that information to tag you for anything. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">So for your next assignment, spend a little time wondering how we ended up in a world where trying not to be tracked doing basic things, to stop companies from making money off our continual attention, somehow became illegal. </span></p>
<h3>Calendars and other office stuff</h3>
<p>Most of the email services you will soon be signing up for to avoid Gmail will also come with a calendar. Apple has calendars too. Or you can try running your own, like using <a href="https://www.sandstorm.io">sandstorm.io</a> -- they let you experiment with running your own mini-server, keeping your data separated even from other tools you spin up yourself.</p>
<p>I'll cover alternatives to Google Meet, gChat, and others in separate posts. And I will devote a lot of time to alternative phones, operating systems, and other home automation machines in future posts too, I promise.</p>
<p><strong>Remember, this doesn't have to be an extreme form of digital veganism</strong>. You're just extracting your life from a platform giant, trying to spread your traces about, and share the love with systems that treat you and your data better.</p>

      Welcome, fellow and aspiring conscientious objectors!
    </h3>

  <p>
    Yes, you can live a modern, digitally connected, twenty-first century life online without Big Tech. You don't have to trade your personal data for "free" services. It's not (always) technically difficult, and you don't have to live in a cave. I've done it, and you can too!
  </p>

  <p>
    I started this site to share the treasure trove of knowledge I've gleaned from over a decade of opting out of data-sucking services.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can start here with <a href="https://www.optoutproject.net/tags/basics/">the Basics</a>, learn more <a href="https://www.optoutproject.net/about-the-opt-out-project/">about the Opt Out project</a>, delve into <a href="https://www.optoutproject.net/tags/the-basics/">the Techniques</a> I've developed to enable my lifestyle, or explore <a href="https://www.optoutproject.net/tags/the-tools/">the Philosophy</a>, the academically-informed thinking behind my unique approach.
  </p>

  <p>
    Or just jump into my reviews of alternative tools and systems: from <a href="https://www.optoutproject.net/tags/email/">email</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.optoutproject.net/tags/phones/">search</a> to <a href="https://www.optoutproject.net/tags/phones/">cell phones</a>&nbsp;and the devices that power <a href="https://www.optoutproject.net/tags/homesteading/">my connected home</a>.&nbsp;
  </p>

  <p>
    Or maybe you want to know who I am--I don't blame you!--more about that is <a href="https://www.optoutproject.net/who-am-i/">here</a> or on my professional website&nbsp;<a href="https://janet.vertesi.com" target="_blank">here</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    It's time to reject toxic tech and usher in a better future. Let's get back in the drivers' seat, demand different tools, and start living a better life online.
  </p>

    <h3 id="dont-drop-out-opt-out">
      Don't drop out, opt out.
