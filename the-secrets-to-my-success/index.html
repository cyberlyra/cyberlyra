She set up a blocker on her router so no sites affiliated with the big three could get through, essentially locking herself out of the internet. She put away her smartphone and found herself without the key tools of daily life. At one point she spent ages on a New York street corner trying desparately to get back into her apartment. This all made for great writing as it all bordered upon the absurd. Finally she gave up, declaring that you cannot live without big tech.</p><p>Kashmir and I spoke years ago after I went viral for concealing a pregnancy from the Internet. I like her and I always appreciate her reporting.</p><p><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">But in this she did us all a disservice. The idea is now firmly planted in people's heads that you simply cannot opt out of Big Tech. It's too hard, they're too big and too pervasive. It's also way too inconvenient: no one wants to be locked out of their apartments, or the Internet for that matter. People have given up.</span></p><p>This is wrong, and it does us a disservice. It strips us of our one major power: the power to choose, to vote with our feet. It robs us of the chance to write our own future, to invest in non-creepy alternatives. And it's untrue. Because you can opt out. I'm living proof. </p><p>So what did Kashmir get wrong? Where do we diverge?</p><h2>1. One system at a time</h2><p>Opting out takes planning and preparation. You will eventually build an entire alternative tech ecosystem from a new series of devices and services. But you cannot leap there all at once. It disrupts too many of your routines, throws too many proverbial babies out with bathwater, and doesn't allow you to build robust relationships or habits that will stick.</p><p>It's kind of like that scene in <em>Airplane</em> where the captain keeps saying, "Looks like I picked the wrong day to quit smoking!" A few minutes later, the same character says, "Looks like I picked the wrong day to quit drinking!" And a few moments after that, "Looks like I picked the wrong day to quit sniffing glue!"</p><p>No one battling an addiction can actually, honestly, beat multiple addictions at once. Addiction is behavioral as much as it is biological. You need time to change those routines and make sure the changes stick. And you have to have enough support so that you don't jump out of the frying pan -- then decide it was pretty cosy in there and you'd rather get right back in again.</p><p>First, I left Google services in 2012. I was dismayed at the change to their privacy policy that allowed them to aggregate all user data around a single profile -- that's enough to make anyone pinpointable in the data, regardless of whether or not it's "anonymized." (More on differential privacy elsewhere: it wasn't an option in 2012).</p><p>I left Facebook in early 2016. I used the same "<a href="https://cyberlyra.github.io/cyberlyra/how-to-the-tech-break-up/">break up</a>" <a href="https://cyberlyra.github.io/cyberlyra/tags/the-basics/">technique</a> but with a few additional twists. After a lot of experimenting with alternative systems, <a href="https://cyberlyra.github.io/cyberlyra/sailfish-the-iphone-and-android-alternative/">I put away my last iPhone for good in 2017</a>. Each of these moments took planning, ensuring I had the right systems in place to leap to, so I wouldn't look back.</p><p><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">Leave Google, Facebook, and Amazon? Yes, sure, you can do that. Leave them </span><em style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">all at once</em><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">? You're setting yourself up to fail.</span></p><h1>2. It can't be all or nothing</h1><p>Perhaps surprisingly for someone who is pretty extreme about data privacy, I don't actually think we need to be so extreme. Kashmir even blocked sites hosted by the big services. Blocking Amazon W3 is like shutting off half the Internet; blocking Microsoft Azure and what are you left with? Geocities or something?</p><p>As much as I'd like to stop these companies from becoming the entire infrastructure to the Internet, I have to marshall my resources to do so. That means I'm going to start with a major part of their money-making business, what fuels their investments in cloud services and what helps them embed themselves into every website on the net.</p><p>That is, I want to break the personal data economy. And we can do that, one person at a time, if we just stop systems from knowing <em>everything </em>about us.</p><p>That's why I don't think we need to leave entirely. We can be selective. As long as you don't let a single platform track you across the web and build up a picture of you, then you are  Just divide your data up across services. Log out of the single log-ins. Set up Ghostery or Firefox containers, or another blocking system that makes it impossible for companies to track you from one site to another.</p><p>We can also obfuscate ourselves by messing with their data. Like my colleagues Finn Brunton and Helen Nissenbaum have done. The systems they've built, like AdNauseum, confuse the heck out of algorithms by collecting messy data. The companies can't see any signal when it's all noise.</p><p>If you really, really need to stay on Facebook, maybe because you are part of a birdwatching group that you love--well then, stay. Just stay <em>only</em> for the birdwatching! Delete the rest of your friends, remove the other data from your profile. Then join every birdwatching group there is. It's that simple.</p><p>Now all Facebook knows about you is that you love birdwatching. They can't serve you Liberal or Conservative ads, or influence you to vote for someone, or show you comments from some high school friend you don't care about. Just birds! Trust me, you'll be a lot happier when you scroll. Especially if you're a bird person.</p><p>What does that do to Facebook? The power of "Meta" is how it tracks us across so many different parts of our lives. It does so with its single profile, its trackers embedded in our browsers when we log in, with all the data that we enter into it, including our statuses and our photographs. Oh, and by confusing us into forgetting that Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp are all actually the same company and therefore the same thing (more on tech gossip elsewhere).</p><p>To break that power, don't show them everything. Just, don't.</p><p>I left Meta but I still have a Twitter account. I got rid of all my other friends and just follow NASA people and open source systems. I don't stay logged in. I make sure that's all Twitter knows about me, and that's fine with me. You're welcome to follow me there, just don't be offended if I don't follow back.</p><p>3. Give us our agency!</p><p>Underlines exactly big tech. They couldn't have paid for better advertising.</p><p> </p><p>This isn't just a personal experiment. I am a conscientious objector, and I believe we must opt out. We are already living through the dangers that were promised by embracing <em>these </em>technologies (not <em>all</em> technologies, these data-sucking algorithmic ones). It's a one-way street to social catastrophe.</p><p>And no, it's not the kind of creative "disruption" that's just the result of innovation. It's irresponsible. Its results are profitable but they are driving children to suicide, reinforcing racism in law enforcement, and fuelling genocide. It doesn't have to be this way.</p><p>But it won't be anything different if we don't make the choice. If we don't choose different systems, we'll keep feeding racist algorithms, manipulative governments, and body dysphoria just by the very act of logging in, liking, commenting and scrolling.</p><p>I wish I could say I had faith in regulation to take this problem away. But I don't. Maybe it's one too many clip making the rounds of a Senator "grilling" a social media guru. Like the time a congressman asked Mark Zuckerberg to turn off "Finsta." By all means, we need smart regulation, and quickly. But those guys aren't riding in on a white horse anytime soon. </p><p>In the meanwhile, it's up to us. Our actions matter. We can opt out, and we must. Like the environmental movement, making small changes in our lives can make a big difference.</p><p>Starting from a place of powerless isn't the way forward. Working together is. </p><p> </p><p> </p></div><footer><div class="post__tags-share"><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://cyberlyra.github.io/cyberlyra/tags/basics/">Basics</a></li><li><a href="https://cyberlyra.github.io/cyberlyra/tags/the-tools/">Philosophy</a></li></ul><aside class="post__share"><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcyberlyra.github.io%2Fcyberlyra%2Fthe-secrets-to-my-success%2F&amp;via=%40cyberlyra&amp;text=The%20Secrets%20to%20Success" class="js-share twitter" aria-label="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://cyberlyra.github.io/cyberlyra/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg></a></aside></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a class="post__nav__link" href="https://cyberlyra.github.io/cyberlyra/this-is-a-first-post-title-2/" rel="prev">Previous Post<h3 class="h6">About the Opt Out Project</h3></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a class="post__nav__link" href="https://cyberlyra.github.io/cyberlyra/my-privacy-policy/" rel="prev">Next Post<h3 class="h6">My Privacy Policy</h3></a></div></nav></footer></div></article></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__social"><a href="@cyberlyra" aria-label="Twitter" class="twitter"><svg><use xlink:href="https://cyberlyra.github.io/cyberlyra/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright Janet Vertesi 2022.
